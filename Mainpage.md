## Precedents

### Sun buckets
Buckets that use PCM's and are heated with a circular heating mirror. They have been implemented around the world; however they only reach temperatures of around 118 celsius, which can boil water but may struggle for more intense cooking. Their PCM's seem to be able to hold a lot of heat but since they rely on the energy released during the freezing of the internal substance, rather than a controllable chemical change.

### Scheffler Community Kitchen

A solar collection system centered around a parabolic heliostat, a satellite-dish shaped mirror that follows the sun's movement, driven by clockwork to ensure alignment with the sun. Perhaps upgrading the mechanical sun tracking to an electronic system would be a worthy improvement as it would not require an operator to adjust it as the sun's path through the sky changes. The system has been used both for cooking and steam generation, which may be useful if we want a closed circuit system that relies on no external power.

### Phase Change Materials 
Mostly hydrous salts, here I look further into the two most readily available options, quicklime and sodium acetate, although other options can be found [***here***](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/salt-hydrate) and may help cover the temperature gap between the two substances explored in further depth.

## Heat Storage Materials

### Citric Acid:
![Citric Acid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90800298/135784281-13f233fc-5425-4067-ba3a-162918caec41.jpeg)


### Pros:
-Cheap, readily available, food safe
-Melting point of 153 degrees Celsius, which is sufficient for boiling water without being a significant water hazard

### Cons:
-Decomposes upon surpassing 175 degrees Celsius, and this chemical change is not easily reversible.


### Quicklime:
![quicklime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90800298/135785145-0bff392d-5d10-474c-bd8c-1fbf081204b2.jpeg)


### Pros: 
-Energy can be stored almost indefinitely and then released as heat through the addition of water, creating calcium hydroxide
-Easily reversible chemical reaction
-Quicklime is an ingredient of cement and is thus ubiquitous
-Can reach high temperatures, up to 300 Celsius
-Temperature reached can be adjusted based on water added
-Potentially a closed loop system, with water being kept separate from CaO but never leaving the machine

### Cons:
-Can be an irritant (as seen on the image) and therefore would have to remain isolated from the food in a solid container.
-Needs to be heated to approximately 400 Celsius.

### Drying Foods

### Pros:
-Time proven and easy to execute
-Requires low temperatures, reducing risk of fires and demand for solar intensity
-Long lifespan of foods, with an upper limit of a year

### Cons:
-Minimal energy is actually stored, but this is acceptable as it still accomplishes the task of preparing food

### Sodium Acetate

### Pros:
-Low temperatures required, safer than other compounds on the list
-Long term energy storage
-Sufficient for slow cooking

### Cons
-Low temperature can be extracted, insufficient to boil water, only reaches 58 degrees
