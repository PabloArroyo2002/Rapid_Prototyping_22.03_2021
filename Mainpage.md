## Heat Storage Materials

### Citric Acid:
![Citric Acid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90800298/135784281-13f233fc-5425-4067-ba3a-162918caec41.jpeg)


### Pros:
-Cheap, readily available, food safe
-Melting point of 153 degrees Celsius, which is sufficient for boiling water without being a significant water hazard

### Cons:
-Decomposes upon surpassing 175 degrees Celsius, and this chemical change is not easily reversible.


### Quicklime:

### Pros: 
-Energy can be stored almost indefinitely and then released as heat through the addition of water, creating calcium hydroxide
-Easily reversible chemical reaction
-Quicklime is an ingredient of cement and is thus ubiquitous
-Can reach high temperatures, up to 300 Celsius
-Temperature reached can be adjusted based on water added
-Potentially a closed loop system, with water being kept separate from CaO but never leaving the machine

### Cons:
-Can be an irritant (as seen on the image) and therefore would have to remain isolated from the food in a solid container.
-Needs to be heated to approximately 400 Celsius.

### Drying Foods

### Pros:
-Time proven and easy to execute
-Requires low temperatures, reducing risk of fires and demand for solar intensity
-Long lifespan of foods, with an upper limit of a year

### Cons:
-Minimal energy is actually stored, but this is acceptable as it still accomplishes the task of preparing food
