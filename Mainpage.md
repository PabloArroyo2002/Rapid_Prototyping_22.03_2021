## Heat Storage Materials

### Citric Acid:
![Citric Acid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90800298/135784281-13f233fc-5425-4067-ba3a-162918caec41.jpeg)


### Pros:
-Cheap, readily available, food safe
-Melting point of 153 degrees Celsius, which is sufficient for boiling water without being a significant water hazard

### Cons:
-Decomposes upon surpassing 175 degrees Celsius, and this chemical change is not easily reversible.


### Quicklime:

### Pros: 
-Energy can be stored almost indefinitely and then released as heat through the addition of water, creating calcium hydroxide
-Easily reversible chemical reaction
-Quicklime is an ingredient of cement and is thus ubiquitous
-Can reach high temperatures, up to 300 Celsius
-Temperature reached can be adjusted based on water added
-Potentially a closed loop system, with water being kept separate from CaO but never leaving the machine

### Cons:
-Can be an irritant (as seen on the image) and therefore would have to remain isolated from the food in a solid container.
-Needs to be heated to approximately 400 Celsius.




### Current Brainstorm Ideas
-Compost Heater: 
Here we see both a diagram and an actual instance of compost heaters being implemented. There is certainly potential for using leaves or food waste in a park to keep a space warmer than its surrounding environment during the winter, and the heat source itself can get as warm as 50 degrees celsius as seen [***here.***](http://compost.css.cornell.edu/physics.html)

-Light Up Platform: 
Using the simple idea of converting potential energy in people's steps, we can light up a small led array, particularly in a high traffic area.

-Lord Kelvin's Thunderstorm: 
As suggested by the name, this contraption was invented by the British scientist Lord Kelvin, all the way back in 1867 and has been used
to show the properties of charged particles and electric fields; however, to my knowledge it has never been used as an artistic installation
or using rain as its primary water source. The ideas would be to demonstrate how we can capture energy from unexpected sources, and would 
demonstrate the energy gathered in the form of a small spark that we can keep behind a small screen for safety (althoug the spark itself
would be no more harmful than one you might get after walking on a rug). Some of the basic information about these contraptions was found

-Solar Air Compressor: 
There are various ways we can harness the sun's heat to create a solar air compressor, ranging from efficient and simple to intricate and didactic. One of the options is to heat air in a channel and to harness it's expansion and desire to rise, thus driving a turbine. Another would be to heat the hot end of a stirling engine to turn the heat almost directly into rotary motion to drive a compressor. Both of these methods have low-scientific risk as the stirling engine and hot air balloon both date back to the Industrial Revolution or earlier.

-Cloud Chamber: 
Although CERN has their own [***guide***](https://home.cern/news/news/experiments/how-make-your-own-cloud-chamber) on how to create a cloud chamber, we do not need the same budget as they have to create a tool to explore and demonstrate the energy that constantly passes through us after travelling for millions, if not billions, of miles in outer space. As shown in the picture below, this device would allow for the viewer of the installation to see the paths of cosmic rays and other charged particles that may be in the environment, but would not need an external source of energy or radiation beyond that of the natural environment.

-Wind powered Van De Graffe Generator: 
What's better than one cool demonstration of energy? Two of course, so we would combine the humble windmill or turbine with a Van De Graffe generator to create endless sparks whenever the wind is blowing. Fortunately, the Van De Graffe generator is powered by a simple driving belt and thus we can use gearing to adjust the output of the windmill.
